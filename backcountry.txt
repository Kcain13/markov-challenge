When going into the backcountry it is necessary to expect the unexpected.

With that being said these are some of the recommendations on how to be prepard when going.

Bring a warm fleece or wool pullover, a waterproof jacket, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. 

As well as lip balm, insect repellant, first-aid kit, pocket knife, and flashlight or headlamp.

Finally waterproof matches, map, compass, a mirror and whistle for signaling if you are lost, plenty of water, and extra food with you.
